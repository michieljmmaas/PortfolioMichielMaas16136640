### Reflection and Evaluation
My roles in the group were Project Planner and Software Engineer. Because of my background in Software Enginering in gravitated to these two roles. I started out my making an extensive schedule to place on our workspace wall. I also made the Trello Board, to track our progress online, and a Scrumboard to divide the task. I took up the role as Product Owner to take the lead in dividing the tasks and manage the backlog.
For the first few weeks these tools were very useful. The schedule gave us a lot of insight and the Scrum Board made everyone tasks very clear. But after we managed to finish most of the work, we were a lot les reliant on these tools.
As I programmer is first started designing the genetic algorithm with Donneley, we talked about how we wanted to handle the tasks, the looping and what paramaters to pass. But after I wanted to help with the coding Donnely was almost finished with the entire algorithm. Instead helping him with the last parts I opted to focus on the Graphical User Interface.
With my experience as Software Engineering I did most of my coding on the Graphical User Interface. For this I used Tkinter, because it is bundled with most python libraries and would me most easily used and improved by my teammembers. The description of the case wrote about “An application” as a deliverable. I focused on making it a visually informative, highly dynamic and easy to execute. This way the user of the program could, with little understanding of the innerworkings, customize their request.
During the development of the UI I had to incorperate a lot of code from other members. While trying to understand their code I would often refactor method and classes to add more options to the code.
This process did not directly contribute to the Datascience portion of the project but did contribute to a nice result for the client.
As I have little problems with public speaking, I would volunteer for holding the presentations.

## 3 Subjects
### Communication
Beschrijven hoe ik in contact bleef met mijn groepje met de dingen die ik deed.
Presentaties die ik heb gegeven. Vaak last minute aangebonden als het niet lukte. En de grote presentaties gehouden wanneer het vroeg. 
Writing on the paper. Start gemaakt, opgedeeld. Aantekeningen genomen bij de uitleg en werkt in de paper
 
 The student prepared or gave more than two  (internal/external) solid presentations.
 The student has made a lot of effort on writing the paper.
 
 
 #### Research Project
 The student has clearly described the context (reason and problem definition) and research questions that are reasonable given the context.
 The student has given several clear and motivated directions for future work.
 The student has discussed the results, illustrated by examples (qualitative analysis)and answers the original research questions based on the findings in this study and has tested the outcomes for statistical significance.
 The student has planned the research project in a good, agile (Scrum) and efficient way.

### Data prepocessing

The student properly examined and visualized the data, distributions, outliers, correlations and used that analysis to give directions for an early hypothesis.

The student cleansed the data in a good and sufficient way.  

The student prepared the data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values, etc.

The student described the the entire dataset  in a good and sufficient way.  

The student correctly visualized the data in support of decisions made for learning the model


### Predictive Analytics
The student has supported their model selection with references from literature
The student explains why the chosen configuration is reasonable (for instance using relevant literature)
The student takes appropriate countermeasures to prevent under- and overfitting and tunes hyperparameters
The student compares several models and additionally explains the differences between the models.
The student has visualized the results both quantatively in a plot and where applicable qualitatively using examples.
